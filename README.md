 Sentiment Analysis Using Natural Language Processing
 
• The main objective to predict the sentiment of a given sentence using my trained model was performed though it has a few boundaries. 
• The process involved scraping the tweets from SUNY Buffalo Twitter pages, pre-processing the text data by removing irrelevant characters and cleaning it, extracting features using bag-of-words and TF-IDF approaches, and training a sequential neural network model with embedding, LSTM, CNN, GRU, and dense output layers. 
• The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
